Classifying ubiquity bugs as duplicates can be difficult because similar tracebacks can have many different causes resulting from different hardware or configuration. It generally necessary to examine the syslog and partman files to fine the exact cause of a crash and this may need to be done by a developer.

To help the process along we can list candidates for duplication on this page and gather data about them to build a case for merging them in each category.

ValueError: invalid literal for int():
Example: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/53783

Seen in versions: Dapper and earlier

Notes: Most of these bugs have had their titles changed to 'debconf frontend went away'. These are *not* firm duplicates, but they share the line ValueError: invalid literal for int(): at the end of their traceback.

Question: Could these be the same as #46569 -- running installer twice simultaneously, 2nd copy explodes ? Could these users all be clicking twice but not reporting it?

Some of them probably are (particularly with Kubuntu - single-clicking on a desktop icon in KDE launches it, so double-clicking launches it twice), but not all; there are some that blow up around partman that can't be that. This crash happens when the debconf frontend that DebconfCommunicator is expecting to talk to crashes instead; specifically, it usually happens either when the debconf database is locked, which indicates that two debconf frontends are running, or when the live filesystem is busted so that debconf crashes in some other unexpected way. As yet, I have no idea why two debconf frontends might be running in the cases where that's been verified. --ColinWatson

Triaging plan: Many of these bugs do not have useful logs, and most look unlikely to get them (after repeated requests). It is normally not advisable to mark as duplicate duplicate bugs where the cause is not fully understood. In this case we have grouped the reports that have the same traceback, that do not have logs and look unlikely to get them. This move has been cleared with the package maintainer, as should be done in such cases. The reason for grouping them will also be marked clearly. Add the debconf-frontend-crash tag to all these bugs.
