One of the forum community members created this howto/faq, due to formatting problems, is was deemed unacceptable for the forum, but due to all the effort c0nstant1n put in to create this, I thought is was a shame that this information be relegated to the Jail, where no one else can benefit from this information.

Screen brightness on laptops, has been a continuing problem through past releases, there have been many bugs reported about this problem, this is by no means a definitive list, but these are the bug reports I've found so far:

#910536 reported by Otto Kekäläinen on 2012-01-01 - the screen is OK in the boot menu (non-X) but as soon as X starts, the backlight of the screen turns off making the screen almost black, and thus unusable.. Pressing Fn+Left Arrow does not increase screen brightness.

#571421 reported by Chris van Hoof on 2010-04-28 - brightness hotkeys not functional

#543294 reported by KlavKalashj on 2010-03-21 - Brightness moves in random direction a couple of times, then stop responding.

#518002 reported by Wolfgang Kufner on 2010-02-06 - backlight dimming not working.

#515214 reported by travauxpublics on 2010-01-31 - i have no control (hardware or software) of brightness. The keyboard does not help any more, like Ubuntu 10.04 does not recognize this function.

#513921 reported by Rolf Leggewie on 2010-01-28 - I found out that the keys for adjusting display brightness (Fn+F5, Fn+F6) don't work as expected.
