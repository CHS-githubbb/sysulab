[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:07:45] Join        [R] has joined this channel (n=rbox@unaffiliated/rbox).
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:07:49] <xHans>     urugTON: so when do you want to do a presentation for PLUG?  :)
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:07:54] <johnc4510-laptop>  ok, we welcome our new folks and let them know that we're always here and you are free to hang out anytime, not just during meetings
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:01] <xHans>     urugTON: and well they should be
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:06] <tyche>     Sounds like the kind of company that should be named "Crash and Burn Recovery Center"
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:08] <johnc4510-laptop>  feel free to ask questions etc
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:26] <johnc4510-laptop>  ok, a couple of announcements from me
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:28] <johnc4510-laptop>  .
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:45] <johnc4510-laptop>  even though Ubuntu just release Intrepid
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:08:50] <urugTON>   good name - not popular in higher IT echelons however
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:02] <johnc4510-laptop>  Jaunty jack the next version is now open for development
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:04] <johnc4510-laptop>  :)
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:12] <johnc4510-laptop>  so a new cycle starts
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:19] <johnc4510-laptop>  .
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:38] <johnc4510-laptop>  there is a new app out there called "Ultamatix"
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:45] <johnc4510-laptop>  it should be avoided
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:53] <SlickMcRunfast>    just like auto?
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:54] <johnc4510-laptop>  it's a third party app
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:09:59] <johnc4510-laptop>  SlickMcRunfast: yes
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:08] <johnc4510-laptop>  it's a spinoff of automatix
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:10] <tyche>     It's the successor to "Automatix".
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:15] <SlickMcRunfast>    automatix messed my system up once
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:17] <johnc4510-laptop>  and it's dangerous to use
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:17] <tyche>     Which was a disaster.
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:30] <johnc4510-laptop>  the script uses a lot or root commands
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:41] <tyche>     And Force flags
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:46] <johnc4510-laptop>  and can leave your system dead or vulnerable
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:51] <johnc4510-laptop>  tyche: right thx
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:10:58] <johnc4510-laptop>  so please avoid this app
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:11:01] <johnc4510-laptop>  .

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:14:22] <xHans>     johnc4510-laptop: "Boot failures on systems with Intel D945 motherboards"

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:15:16] <johnc4510-laptop>  this time instead of 400, we got 350
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:15:23] <johnc4510-laptop>  the difference was
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:15:36] <johnc4510-laptop>  we didn't get any 64bit desktop cds
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:15:40] <johnc4510-laptop>  not sure why
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:15:57] <johnc4510-laptop>  but i rechecked the wiki page and we got what we were suppose to
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:16:03] <johnc4510-laptop>  if i had to guess
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:16:17] <johnc4510-laptop>  it's economic related
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:16:26] <johnc4510-laptop>  but we have our supply
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:16:27] <johnc4510-laptop>  :)

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:34:06] <xHans>     slofgren: I think it'll bring less people from PLUG, but maybe it'll get more of Randy's students

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:37:36] <johnc4510-laptop>  the game server would be a great thing to promote for the phoenix installfest i think

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:38:08] <johnc4510-laptop>  other than that, i

[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:39:20] <tyche>     That can be dealt with outside of the meeting, though.
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:39:23] <johnc4510-laptop>  i think with the price of gas, it will be cheapest to mail them
[Sun Nov 9 2008] [21:39:23] <johnc4510-laptop>  ??
